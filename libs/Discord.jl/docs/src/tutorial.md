!!! warning
    This is outdated, the regular documentation is a better reference.

*The completed and cleaned-up code can be found in [`wager.jl`](https://github.com/Xh4H/Discord.jl/blob/master/examples/wager.jl).*

In this tutorial, we're going to build a very basic currency/wager bot with Discord.jl.
The bot will give users the following capabilities:

* Receive tokens from the bot on a regular interval
* See their current token count
* See a leaderboard of the top earners in the guild
* Give tokens to other users by username
* Wager tokens on a coin flip

A couple of rules apply:

* Users cannot wager or give more tokens than they currently have (this means that users cannot go into debt)
* Users cannot give tokens to users in a different guild

Let's get started! First of all, we need to import Discord.jl, and we'll also start a `main` function which we'll add to as we go along.

```julia
using Discord

function main()
    c = Client(ENV["DISCORD_TOKEN"]; prefix='!')
    # To be continued...
end
```

Next, let's think about how we want to maintain the state of our application.
According to the requirements and rules outlined above, we need to track users by username and their token count, which is nonnegative, by guild.
Therefore, our internal state representation is going to be a mapping from guild IDs to mappings from usernames to token counts via a `Dict{Discord.Snowflake, Dict{String, UInt}}`.
In this example, we aren't particularly concerned with persistent storage so we'll just keep everything in memory.

```julia
const TOKENS = Dict{Discord.Snowflake, Dict{String, UInt}}()
```

Now, since this `Dict` starts off empty, how are we going to populate it with users?
We can do this by defining a handler on [`GuildCreate`](@ref), whose `guild` field contains its own ID, as well as a list of [`Member`](@ref)s, each of which contains a [`User`](@ref), and therefore a username.

```julia
const TOKEN_START = 100

function add_users(c::Client, e::GuildCreate)
    if !haskey(TOKENS, e.guild.id)
        TOKENS[e.guild.id] = Dict()
    end

    guild = TOKENS[e.guild.id]

    for m in e.guild.members
        if !haskey(guild, m.user.username)
            guild[m.user.username] = TOKEN_START
        end
    end
end
```

Let's add that handler to our [`Client`](@ref), and connect to the gateway with [`open`](@ref):

```julia
function main()
    # ...
    add_handler!(c, GuildCreate, add_users)
    open(c)
end
```

With that taken care of, we can start distributing tokens.
First, we need to decide how often to distribute tokens, and how many should be given.

```julia
using Dates

const TOKEN_INTERVAL = Minute(30)
const TOKEN_INCREMENT = 100
```

Now, we can write a function to give out tokens on this interval, and get it running in the background.

```julia
function distribute_tokens(c::Client)
    while isopen(c)
        for g in keys(TOKENS)
            for u in keys(g)
                g[u] += TOKEN_INCREMENT
            end
        end
        sleep(TOKEN_INTERVAL)
    end
end

function main()
    # ...
    @async distribute_tokens()
end
```

Next, we need to let users see their token count.
We can do this by adding a few helpers, and a *command* via [`add_command!`](@ref).

```julia
# Insert a guild and/or user from a message into the token cache if they don't exist.
function ensure_updated(m::Message)
    if !haskey(TOKENS, m.guild_id)
        TOKENS[m.guild_id] = Dict()
    end
    if !haskey(TOKENS[m.guild_id], m.author.username)
        TOKENS[m.guild_id][m.author.username] = TOKEN_START
    end
end

# Get the token count for the user who sent a message.
token_count(m::Message) = get(get(TOKENS, m.guild_id, Dict()), m.author.username, 0)

function reply_token_count(c::Client, m::Message)
    ensure_updated(m)
    reply(c, m, "You have $(token_count(m)) tokens.")
end

function main()
    # ...
    add_command!(c, :count, reply_token_count)
end
```

When a user types "!count", the bot will reply with their token count.
Next, we can easily implement the guild leaderboard for the "!leaderboard" command.

```julia
function reply_token_leaderboard(c::Client, m::Message)
    ensure_updated(m)

    # Get user => token count pairs by token count in descending order.
    sorted = sort(collect(TOKENS[m.guild_id]); by=p -> p.second, rev=true)

    entries = String[]
    for i in 1:min(10, length(sorted))  # Display at most 10.
        user, tokens = sorted[i]
        push!(entries, "$user: $tokens")
    end

    reply(c, m, join(entries, "\n"))
end

function main()
    # ...
    add_command!(c, :leaderboard, reply_token_leaderboard)
end
```

Next, we can implement the sending of tokens between users.
We need to do a few new things:

* Parse the number of tokens and the recipient from the command
* Check that the user sending the tokens has enough to send
* Check that both users are in the same guild

```julia
function send_tokens(c::Client, m::Message)
    ensure_updated(m)

    words = split(m.content)
    if length(words) < 3
        return reply(c, m, "Invalid !send command.")
    end

    tokens = tryparse(UInt, words[2])
    tokens === nothing && return reply(c, m, "'$(words[2])' is not a valid number.")

    recipient = words[3]
    if !haskey(TOKENS[m.guild_id], recipient)
        return reply(c, m, "Couldn't find user '$recipient' in this guild.")
    end
    if token_count(m) < tokens
        return reply(c, m, "You don't have enough tokens to give.")
    end

    TOKENS[m.guild_id][m.author.username] -= tokens
    TOKENS[m.guild_id][recipient] += tokens
    reply(c, m, "You sent $tokens tokens to $recipient.")
end

function main()
    # ...
    add_command!(c, :send, send_tokens)
end
```

Easy!
And last but not least, we'll add the wagering command.

```julia
function wager_tokens(c::Client, m::Message)
    ensure_updated(m)

    words = split(m.content)
    if length(words) < 2
        return reply(c, m, "Invalid !wager command.")
    end

    tokens = try
        parse(UInt, words[2])
    catch
        return reply(c, m, "'$(words[2])' is not a valid number of tokens.")
    end
    if token_count(m) < tokens
        return reply(c, m, "You don't have enough tokens to wager.")
    end

    if rand() > 0.5
        TOKENS[m.guild_id][m.author.username] += tokens
        reply(c, m, "You win!")
    else
        TOKENS[m.guild_id][m.author.username] -= tokens
        reply(c, m, "You lose.")
    end
end

function main()
    # ...
    add_command!(c, :wager, wager_tokens)
    wait(c)
end
```

The [`wait`](@ref) command at the end of `main` blocks until the client disconnects.

And that's it!
Run this `main` function with the `$DISCORD_TOKEN` environment variable set and see your bot in action.

!!! note
    Plenty of corners were cut here, so please don't see this as best practices for bot creation!
    It's just meant to demonstrate some features and help you get your feet wet.
